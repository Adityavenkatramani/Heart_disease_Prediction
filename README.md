The project aims at predicting if a person has heart disease or not
This is done using a Logistic regression model where relationships are shown with respeect to the Dependent and independent variables
The dataset used is the heart_disease_data.csv
The steps involve - DataPreprocessing -> Train,Test,Split -> Logistic Regression Model
#The dataset Consists of
"""
1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14.The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values."""
